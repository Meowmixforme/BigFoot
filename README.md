# ðŸ¦¶ BigFoot

## Project Overview

BigFoot is a comprehensive analytics tool designed for the analysis of Bigfoot sighting data, utilising machine learning and data visualisation. The application imports verified sighting reports from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organisation (BFRO) database and processes them to reveal insights about when, where, and what types of encounters occur.

## Data Source

The project employs data from the BFRO (Bigfoot Field Researchers Organisation) database, which includes:

- Over 4,000 North American sightings from the 1960s to the present
- Reports classified into Class A, B, and C categories
- Geographic coordinates and timestamps
- Eyewitness reports, track findings, and audio encounters

**BFRO Classification System:**
- **Class A:** Clear visual sighting in good conditions by a reliable witness (highest quality)
- **Class B:** Possible visual or clear audio encounter, but lacking Class A clarity
- **Class C:** Second-hand reports, stories, or anecdotal evidence (least reliable)
