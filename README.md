# ðŸ¦¶ BigFoot

## Project Overview

BigFoot is a comprehensive analytics tool designed for the analysis of Bigfoot sighting data, utilising machine learning and data visualisation. The application imports verified sighting reports from the [BFRO](https://www.bfro.net/) (Bigfoot Field Researchers Organisation) and provides interactive dashboards, maps, and predictive tools for exploring cryptid reports.

> _I'm a longtime fan of the BFRO and the TV series [Finding Bigfoot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1948830/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_finding%2520bigf), which inspired me to create this project to explore and visualise Bigfoot sighting data._

## Data Source

The primary dataset used in this project is [bfro_locations.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kittychew/bigfoot-sightings-analysis/main/bfro_locations.csv), originally sourced and cleaned by [@kittychew/bigfoot-sightings-analysis](https://github.com/kittychew/bigfoot-sightings-analysis) from the [@timothyrenner/bfro_sightings_data](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data) dataset, and ultimately derived from the [Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO)](https://www.bfro.net/) database. Additional data files (such as bfro_reports.json and bfro_reports_geocoded.csv) from @kittychewâ€™s repository are also referenced.

**Attribution:**  
- Special thanks to the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) for providing the original dataset.  
- Thanks to [@kittychew/bigfoot-sightings-analysis](https://github.com/kittychew/bigfoot-sightings-analysis) for data cleaning, processing, and  to [@timothyrenner/bfro_sightings_data](https://data.world/timothyrenner/bfro-sightings-data) for making the dataset publicly available under the MIT License.

The project employs data from the BFRO database, which includes:
- Over 4,000 North American sightings from the 1960s to the present
- Reports classified into Class A, B, and C categories
- Geographic coordinates and timestamps
- Eyewitness reports, track findings, and audio encounters

**BFRO Classification System:**
- **Class A:** Clear visual sighting in good conditions by a reliable witness (highest quality)
- **Class B:** Possible visual or clear audio encounter, but lacking Class A clarity
- **Class C:** Second-hand reports, stories, or anecdotal evidence (least reliable)
